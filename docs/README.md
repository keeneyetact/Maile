# PHPMailer Documentation

Pre-built PHPMailer API documentation is not provided with the PHP classes, but you can generate API documentation by running the `generatedocs.sh` shell script in this folder. You will need to have [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed. This documentation is also [available online](http://phpmailer.github.io/PHPMailer/), though it may not be quite up to date or match your version.

Further help and information is available in [the PHPMailer README](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/README.md), [the examples folder](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples), and in [the GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki).

Fixes and additions to documentation are welcome - please submit pull requests or improve wiki pages.
